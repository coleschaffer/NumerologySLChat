1
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.481
Copy Accelerator: Hello to everybody coming in. We'll get started in just a minute. Gonna let

2
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.980
Copy Accelerator: few more people

3
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.539
Copy Accelerator: pop in here.

4
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.279
Copy Accelerator: It's nice nice seeing a lot of people though you know a combination of

5
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.729
Copy Accelerator: new and familiar faces so pretty excited about that.

6
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.620
Copy Accelerator: And

7
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.350
Copy Accelerator: first and foremost, I guess.

8
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.139
Copy Accelerator: Let me just say it's great to see all of you that are in here. It is

9
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:39.269
Copy Accelerator: an honor to be working with each and every one of you, and whether you are a member of a team or the owner of a business. You know, pretty pumped for what we're doing here. If the relaunch will be.

10
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.839
Copy Accelerator: you know, doing weekly trainings like this one where we'll be going through different concepts. You know, skills, everything around

11
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.750
Copy Accelerator: direct consumer marketing, director response marketing. Ecom applies to B, twob, as well

12
00:01:54.702 --> 00:02:12.130
Copy Accelerator: everything around both copy and cr things. And all the above. So yeah, for those of you've been with us for a while, like I see. You know, Dario and Frank and Ben Mark, a few other people like that. Good to see you guys and everyone who is

13
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:25.035
Copy Accelerator: brand new. I've never met good to meet you, and for those of you who I know but haven't seen a while like Moni, who just hopped in here. Great to see you as well, and I like the other the other stuffing in here, Stefan. By shoe. So glad to see a

14
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.189
Copy Accelerator: I follow Stefan.

15
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:50.141
Copy Accelerator: So one cool thing we'll do in the future with these calls is we will sometimes lead off with like wins. So just wins that you've gotten you know whether it's for your business or for the company you're a part of, or whatever it is. You know I love doing that for momentum. Since this is a brand new kind of initial training. In our first session, I won't lead off with that one today. Instead.

16
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.259
Copy Accelerator: we're pretty quickly gonna dive right in. And I'm gonna

17
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.359
Copy Accelerator: talk and share. And

18
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.079
Copy Accelerator: we'll also have options for our opportunities for questions and

19
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.860
Copy Accelerator: to interact with each other and all of that as well. So

20
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.769
Copy Accelerator: for everyone who's here let me go and share my screen. And of course, this is being recorded as well.

21
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.250
Copy Accelerator: Alright. So what we're talking about today

22
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.960
Copy Accelerator: is, gonna be big ideas. But I'll show you like, this is like you probably have seen. You may have seen me mentioned this previously.

23
00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:41.779
Copy Accelerator: Let me make sure I'm able to let other people in who show up if they come in. You know, we're gonna go to go through all kinds of stuff in the coming weeks. So everything from like, you know, email swipes and ecom type of stuff to, you know. Long form, of course, like ads of all sorts, you know, funnels, cr things.

24
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.170
Copy Accelerator: unique mechanisms, deep market research.

25
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.159
Copy Accelerator: Yadda, yadda, yadda, we'll kind of go through

26
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.700
Copy Accelerator: all the good stuff.

27
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.680
Copy Accelerator: But the way it makes sense to really teach, you know, out the gate is

28
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:06.079
Copy Accelerator: more fundamental level things which doesn't mean easy or or basic necessarily. But it means things are really applicable broadly. So that would include stuff like big ideas.

29
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:14.740
Copy Accelerator: unique mechanisms, angles, hooks, all that good stuff that can then be applied to all sorts of

30
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.807
Copy Accelerator: funnels offers types of copy everything.

31
00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.160
Copy Accelerator: And we're gonna start off today.

32
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.130
Copy Accelerator: as you may have known from my email, I want to put on Whatsapp talking about big ideas.

33
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.410
Copy Accelerator: And we'll talk about. You know what they are

34
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.440
Copy Accelerator: today, especially kind of what they are, a bit of how to come up with them

35
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.769
Copy Accelerator: and really recognizing big ideas in the wild. And also

36
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.290
Copy Accelerator: yeah, a little technique for sort of

37
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.819
Copy Accelerator: both analyzing and coming up with big ideas. We're gonna spend like a couple of weeks on big ideas. Because, frankly.

38
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.760
Copy Accelerator: we can. I'd rather do that than try to rush anything that I'm teaching, especially if it's a concept that is important. But we'll have different

39
00:04:55.112 --> 00:05:11.280
Copy Accelerator: kind of things in different weeks. So today will be kind of like a broad overview and a little bit of you know some examples and some specificity. As I was preparing this honestly came up with a pretty cool, some cool ideas for for AI, like like a a Gpt type of thing, I think that I can create that will

40
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.820
Copy Accelerator: analyze big ideas for you and also potentially come up with big ideas. I've got some other ways to do that, both

41
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.596
Copy Accelerator: analog and with AI that I'll also teach. But

42
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:29.849
Copy Accelerator: You know I have some cool ideas for things I'll probably build out after this call and share as resources for our members. And you'll see

43
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:37.459
Copy Accelerator: really like, actually, I'll just, I'll just spoil. I'm I'm terrible at secrets and surprises. There's nothing there's nothing crazy of this. But really, it's actually a pretty simple little

44
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.689
Copy Accelerator: structure, right as you're gonna see here. And if you read my my email that I linked to people to really kind of which is really like when you look at a big idea. And we're gonna talk about this in much more depth.

45
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:54.190
Copy Accelerator: Really, like all any idea is is a combination of old ideas. Okay? And again, being a little ahead of myself. But if that's true.

46
00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:00.509
Copy Accelerator: then really, you know, it's the same thing for a big idea. It's just that the big idea also has a few other characteristics.

47
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:10.764
Copy Accelerator: right? So which is that it's, you know. Can you immediately understand it? Does it feel important or exciting or beneficial? And does it support the copy that?

48
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:20.509
Copy Accelerator: you know, and selling the product right? So they'll make more sense in a minute. But really, this is like a little framework we're gonna have for big ideas that we'll we'll talk through here.

49
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:31.310
Copy Accelerator: And so the first 5, 7 min of this will be, you know, similar to what I wrote in the that email, and that I shared, but still worth going through it live together.

50
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:43.090
Copy Accelerator: And then, yeah, we'll branch out and do some other things on top of that. But I think it's good to do it live, and if you have questions as we get going in, general, put them in the chat to start. I'm definitely cool with like people.

51
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:52.520
Copy Accelerator: you know, unmute themselves. And we can actually have like a dialog. But initially, while I'm going through this stuff, I think if you just pop stuff into chat, that's probably the easiest way to do it.

52
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.960
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So

53
00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:11.770
Copy Accelerator: you know, like, I just sort of mentioned and and alluded to it like, I think, like, I guess, let's just put this in the chat, who here feels like you have a good grasp on big ideas, and here it doesn't maybe say yes or no. You can just pop it in the chat like, yes, I feel good about it. No, I'm kind of like a little

54
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.680
Copy Accelerator: confused on big ideas, whatever it may be right.

55
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.719
Copy Accelerator: Okay. See some yeses coming in? That's cool.

56
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.300
Copy Accelerator: Think Darius is a math? Some guesses

57
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.019
Copy Accelerator: 50 50 bit confused. Yes, sort of

58
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.040
Copy Accelerator: cool.

59
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.191
Copy Accelerator: Yeah. I mean. So, to be honest with you guys, I feel like

60
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:37.960
Copy Accelerator: I feel like I really get big ideas now. But I feel like, even after I was a really highly successful

61
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.380
Copy Accelerator: copyrighter and marketer. It was sort of hard for me to

62
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.803
Copy Accelerator: to explain it. It was more like there's a classic

63
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.629
Copy Accelerator: thing in the Us. Where there was a Supreme Court case about

64
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:53.509
Copy Accelerator: like, you know, pornography essentially, and the definition was like.

65
00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:17.279
Copy Accelerator: you can't define pornography, but you know it when you see it right. And that's sort of this famous line from a Supreme Court justice in the Us. And I think in a lot of cases we feel that way about big ideas as well. We're like, well, I can't. You know. I don't know exactly how to define it, but you know, when you see it. But you know David Ogilvy, who's obviously one of well, hopefully, obviously one of the the great kind of marketers and advertising people of all time

66
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.800
Copy Accelerator: had his definition of a big idea.

67
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:30.039
Copy Accelerator: which is like an idea that is instantly comprehended as important, exciting, and beneficial. It also leads to an inevitable conclusion, a conclusion that makes it easy to sell your product.

68
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.569
Copy Accelerator: Okay, so we're gonna talk about what that actually means today.

69
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:43.689
Copy Accelerator: But before we do that like I had in the email that I sent out and that I shared with you guys, I do want to go to an even more basic question of like, All right. Well, what's an idea? And I already kind of

70
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:50.750
Copy Accelerator: spoiled it a little bit by saying, You know ultimately what it is is a combination of older ideas. So

71
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.250
Copy Accelerator: you know, I mentioned like David Hume, who's like a Scottish boss from the eighteenth century, because I couldn't help myself.

72
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:06.317
Copy Accelerator: but really like David Hume is just an example of like people have been thinking about this for a long time. Actually, it's really interesting from my perspective. But really he's sort of like it's just like,

73
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.869
Copy Accelerator: you know, taking things and combining them together. And he talks about this example of a golden mountain

74
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.379
Copy Accelerator: right. When we think of a golden mountain, we only join 2 consistent ideas, gold and mountain.

75
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.530
Copy Accelerator: with which we were formally acquainted.

76
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:27.080
Copy Accelerator: And so basically, yeah, ideas or combinations of other elements. And there's a famous book by James Webb Young, called A Technique for Producing ideas.

77
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.559
Copy Accelerator: and he sort of has a similar thing, though, and less philosophical

78
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:44.847
Copy Accelerator: way. But you know, he says, an idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements. And so really, this concept is like, you're just taking 2 things gold Mountain combined together, gold and mountain, right like

79
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.139
Copy Accelerator: And that's sort of it. If you think about like, I mean, maybe take a minute

80
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.920
Copy Accelerator: to think about some kind of idea you would have like and

81
00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:00.789
Copy Accelerator: like, what is it? Really? Here's a funny example, right? Think of like a superhero. Right? All it is is usually like.

82
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.370
Copy Accelerator: you know, like a super super woman or superman, right? Like some man or a woman

83
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.329
Copy Accelerator: who's got super powers

84
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.749
Copy Accelerator: combined together right? Like really anything you would think of

85
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:21.540
Copy Accelerator: from a perspective of an idea is really just a combination of other ideas, and you can get super philosophical. But that is for a different thing than you know. Kind of in-depth.

86
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.729
Copy Accelerator: copyrighting, training and marketing training and all that kind of stuff.

87
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.980
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So

88
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.040
Copy Accelerator: when you go back to Ogilby's definition of a big idea which, again, was like.

89
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:40.580
Copy Accelerator: you know, an idea that is instantly comprehended as important, exciting, and beneficial, and it leads to an inevitable conclusion that makes it easy to sell your product.

90
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:46.640
Copy Accelerator: you know. Really, if we take that and break it down to that big idea, definition to basic elements.

91
00:10:46.860 --> 00:11:01.500
Copy Accelerator: all we're doing. And I got a real little space. So we don't get to that overwhelmed, you know, all we're doing is basically in a big idea, is taking 2 previous ideas, combined them in a new way that feels important, excited, beneficial, and helps you to sell your stuff

92
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:08.489
Copy Accelerator: right this parts from my email. We don't need to go too deep on that. But let's instead, look at a couple of examples, and then we'll go back to

93
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.449
Copy Accelerator: the elements of the big idea, and we'll look at the framework, and we're going to do some together as like a workshop.

94
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.940
Copy Accelerator: Right? So

95
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:21.989
Copy Accelerator: those of you who looked at the document saw the email. This is one that I wrote for a gut kind of offer

96
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.320
Copy Accelerator: a few years back was partnered in.

97
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:41.369
Copy Accelerator: and it's got like as is like that. The headline complexes we call it. It's got the big headline, a little bit of a copy before it what you would call a pre header. A bit of sort of post headline copy, so like post header right could hidden constipation be the real culprit behind our bloated, sworn stomachs.

98
00:11:41.899 --> 00:12:01.719
Copy Accelerator: Plus the simple 20 s sorry one of America's most celebrated doctor reveals bombshell discovery could hid in constipation be the real culprit behind our bloated swelling stomachs, plus a simple 20 s fix that can rapidly improve digestion. Some downer bellies return about movements, regularity without any detoxes, master cleanses, or turning your insides into a gurgling, swirling vortex of discomfort.

99
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.249
Copy Accelerator: So I

100
00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.110
Copy Accelerator: you know, feel like I'm pretty happy with the copy. But this did pretty well.

101
00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.080
Copy Accelerator: and it's like, Okay, well, what's the big idea? And

102
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.680
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. Maybe intuitively, if you go back to the the

103
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.879
Copy Accelerator: the pornography definition of you'll know when you see it.

104
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.629
Copy Accelerator: It's like hidden constipation, right? Is this thing called hidden constipation behind

105
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.880
Copy Accelerator: your issues. Okay?

106
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:37.306
Copy Accelerator: And so then really like what I what I like to do. And this is maybe one of my super powers with a lot of stuff. If you go back to like Rmbc and just breaking down processes and things is bringing down to really basic elements. Right?

107
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.969
Copy Accelerator: are like the constituent parts of like a whole.

108
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:49.639
Copy Accelerator: And so really, all we have here, if we're if we're thinking, we're trying to combine, you know, old ideas to create a new idea. And in this case a new big idea. Then it's like, all right. What are the building blocks?

109
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.389
Copy Accelerator: One of them is like constipation.

110
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.879
Copy Accelerator: and the other one is like a secret hidden problem right?

111
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:08.739
Copy Accelerator: now so arbitrary, you could phrase it different ways within a day like it's hidden. Constipation is culprit. So it's really like if we just if we just simplify a way for an idea, it's like constipation, a secret, hidden problem.

112
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.250
Copy Accelerator: So

113
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.140
Copy Accelerator: you know, as I put here, ideal block number one is sort of self-explanatory.

114
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.770
Copy Accelerator: but for the second one, right?

115
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.785
Copy Accelerator: Why is it powerful? Well, it does. It helps. If you know the market you're speaking to. We are going to go through market research very in depth.

116
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:34.909
Copy Accelerator: not today, necessarily, but you know, in a future training. Before long this one of the things we're gonna go very deep on is like market research, both like the analog way and using AI as well.

117
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:45.189
Copy Accelerator: But if you know your market a bit. You know you're writing to your market. Regularly, you are immersed like this is why research is really important. Then, for example, we've got health.

118
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:52.670
Copy Accelerator: What you tend to find is that there's this common refrain of both in the copy and that people kind of mention

119
00:13:54.090 --> 00:14:00.470
Copy Accelerator: where there's sort of like, I know. Something's messed up with my gut, but nobody seems able to diagnose it like not even me.

120
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:10.370
Copy Accelerator: And this is something that you know you'll see in golden hippo, and Gundry offers going back several years still gets used today. There's this idea of like.

121
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.250
Copy Accelerator: And, by the way, it's not just for gut, really?

122
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.780
Copy Accelerator: it really ties into like a kind of core copy concept of, like.

123
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:28.219
Copy Accelerator: you know, often like, it's not really your fault, right like, hey? It's not your fault. This sort of like hidden culprit is been going on, and you haven't known about it.

124
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.420
Copy Accelerator: and that's actually pretty universal. Whether that is health, whether it's like.

125
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.599
Copy Accelerator: you know, biz, OP, or whatever it is training education. You know, typically, it's like.

126
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.760
Copy Accelerator: whether it said really explicitly or implied, it's typically like, Hey, you know, it's not really

127
00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:47.480
Copy Accelerator: your fault. And in the gut space it's often like

128
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.500
Copy Accelerator: that.

129
00:14:50.120 --> 00:15:13.930
Copy Accelerator: It's yeah. It's not my fault. And in fact, I can't, but it's frustrating. It may have been like it, but I'm also frustrated. There's all frustration, and that's actually common to pretty universal as well, right like they're frustrated because they know something's going on. They've tried probiotics. They've tried detoxes maybe they've gone and talked to their doctor, and their doctor is sort of like. I don't know. Nothing's wrong with you. It's in your head, and they feel really, you know, frustrated and like what's going on here.

130
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:22.249
Copy Accelerator: and so like I put here. They're kind of saying like, I know they're saying messed up in my gut, but nobody seems able to diagnose it, not even me. So back to it being hidden.

131
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:28.140
Copy Accelerator: And you know, of course, they would love for what's hidden to be illuminated so they can start to look and feel better.

132
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.619
Copy Accelerator: And that's what we're promising to reveal in here something that could be the real cause

133
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.260
Copy Accelerator: which is hidden constipation.

134
00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:47.569
Copy Accelerator: And that would help us to sell our product right? So going back to that thing here, it's like, okay, idea, building block, one constipation building block 2, there's something hidden that's causing your issues.

135
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.990
Copy Accelerator: And then, if we're like, Okay, well, what's like the.

136
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.379
Copy Accelerator: you know, how does this help us sell? Sell the product? Well.

137
00:15:53.540 --> 00:16:02.660
Copy Accelerator: if, like, we're going to tell you that, like, you know, this hidden conservation thing is really the cause, and we're going to show you how to fix it. Then, obviously, if our product helps to fix it, they're going to want to buy it.

138
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.020
Copy Accelerator: Okay.

139
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:12.308
Copy Accelerator: hopefully, this is making sense. I don't know if I'm going too fast. We are going to spend time. I kind of want to get through an overview and then get to sort of workshopping things.

140
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:19.710
Copy Accelerator: are you guys following what I'm saying thus far, Army says, makes sense alright cool. I'm seeing some head nods. So that's good. Okay.

141
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.719
Copy Accelerator: awesome. Armen. Thank you. Glad to. Glad to hear that

142
00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:35.159
Copy Accelerator: And again, like what you know to to cheat a little bit. If you go back to like this criteria which I'll be sharing. I'll share all this stuff of everybody. In fact, I may move this into like a second document. Now.

143
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.570
Copy Accelerator: just to cheat a little

144
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.840
Copy Accelerator: me one sec here.

145
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:54.009
Copy Accelerator: So sort of like, if we have this criteria. Okay, building block one again, I'm not going to write it in this one yet. I have it mapped out for us below, like constipation.

146
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.180
Copy Accelerator: something, you know, hidden. And you know, saying, hidden, that's causing your problems.

147
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.699
Copy Accelerator: Right? Is it? Instantly comprehensible to me? It's like, yeah, because.

148
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:15.660
Copy Accelerator: like, it's just curiosity. But you know the concept of constipation. And so this idea that, like, there might be some kind of secret constipation like I I don't. I don't know if anybody doesn't get it. Maybe you want to know more, but you don't like not. You're not like what's constipation like.

149
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:23.399
Copy Accelerator: I think it is important. What's certainly important to somebody who's suffering from these pain points and problems?

150
00:17:24.147 --> 00:17:25.730
Copy Accelerator: Is it exciting?

151
00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:31.419
Copy Accelerator: You know I feel like it is. Of course we can use copy to to enhance the excitement of it. Like.

152
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:41.210
Copy Accelerator: you know, there's one of America's most celebrated doctors reveals this bombshell discovery. Obviously, that copy is being used to make it seem even more exciting like this. Momentous.

153
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.590
Copy Accelerator: you know. Event.

154
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.459
Copy Accelerator: And is it beneficial?

155
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:53.740
Copy Accelerator: Well, yeah, obviously, if I can fix my, you know, do a 20 s fix, I can improve digestion and do all these sorts of things without

156
00:17:53.810 --> 00:18:00.839
Copy Accelerator: all the kind of crap that I would normally do, and not like that. That seems really beneficial. And, like we mentioned, you know, does it support

157
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.749
Copy Accelerator: the copy and selling the product, like, you know, definitely it does right? And so

158
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.589
Copy Accelerator: one of the big takeaways from today's call.

159
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.567
Copy Accelerator: And then again, I will share all this with everybody. But

160
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:21.079
Copy Accelerator: is like this is a very nice and simple framework for analyzing. When you have a big idea, and we're gonna look at some ads, too. By the way, I'm starting with like longer form stuff. But

161
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:22.767
Copy Accelerator: you know, like,

162
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.679
Copy Accelerator: what's the method of using our Internet? I'll come back to that in a second. But

163
00:18:29.148 --> 00:18:37.729
Copy Accelerator: you know, this alone should be really valuable. As you go to kind of analyze or critique. You know your big ideas, or big ideas and copy or things of that nature.

164
00:18:38.439 --> 00:18:50.040
Copy Accelerator: Now, Ben had asked, what's the benefit of using our and the headline versus using your, I think, honestly been at the time for that one, especially with Facebook compliance, which is one of the main places we were running traffic.

165
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:56.340
Copy Accelerator: Just didn't want to use your as like a call out type of thing. You know, compliance is sort of

166
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.699
Copy Accelerator: continues to be a really tricky place, because a lot of people feel like, Oh, you can never use your and Facebook copy. But

167
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.860
Copy Accelerator: yeah, you can just just depends on a lot of of

168
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.600
Copy Accelerator: different kind of nuance. And so

169
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.940
Copy Accelerator: it was just R to to make it feel more like.

170
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.330
Copy Accelerator: I guess so, to to not worry about compliance as we were watching that.

171
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:25.750
Copy Accelerator: Yes, sir, of course, Dario, how did you decide if the big idea should be mechanism of problem or mechanism of solution?

172
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.190
Copy Accelerator: Cool? Yeah. So

173
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.360
Copy Accelerator: I mean tick, typically

174
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.760
Copy Accelerator: typically, you kind of mentioned both. But but usually

175
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.814
Copy Accelerator: I'm trying to think through this. And we'll we'll, you know, for those who are newer to. Obviously, we'll talk about mechanisms a lot more. But

176
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.219
Copy Accelerator: like for this one. For example. Okay, if the problem is like

177
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.979
Copy Accelerator: pain, conservation is causing this, you know. Usually the solution

178
00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.270
Copy Accelerator: is

179
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.419
Copy Accelerator: pretty simple. Now, in your guys's case.

180
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:06.890
Copy Accelerator: I won't name. I won't. I don't talk about what you guys sell on this coffee on my way to Dario. But right? But it's it's a good device. I'll just. I'll just say that. And so like that is like.

181
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.319
Copy Accelerator: you know.

182
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:27.400
Copy Accelerator: you're usually still talking about, I started to say is about without, say, what you guys have. But like, basically, what out generally is problem. Let's just leave that for now we'll go deeper as we as we go. Generally the problem. And maybe you're talking about fixing the problem a little bit. But you're you're more so calling out the problem because it's more

183
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.359
Copy Accelerator: like it's almost diagnostic more often than it is like.

184
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:42.150
Copy Accelerator: Hey, there's a solution like, you know, even if you know, maybe you're teasing some aspect of the solution. But but generally the problem is what somebody is more interested in, and and what you call it more often. And then you, of course, promise

185
00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:44.238
Copy Accelerator: you weave in like sort of

186
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.570
Copy Accelerator: you know, promises that you're gonna fix that problem for them. And they're gonna see how

187
00:20:48.819 --> 00:20:54.469
Copy Accelerator: or or you know, if it was an add and you're going really quickly. And hey, but this is like a product that that fixes the problem.

188
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.239
Copy Accelerator: But generally we go problem focus.

189
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:04.770
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So the next one, I kind of shared in that email. And then again, I do have a bunch of additional examples that weren't

190
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.389
Copy Accelerator: in that email. That'll be fun to go through

191
00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:12.990
Copy Accelerator: right? Was this be your control thing? I did maybe 2 years back, 3 years back. I don't know. 2

192
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:13.525
Copy Accelerator: for

193
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:24.189
Copy Accelerator: I have 21, which is like, you know, Steve. Guns like. He just talked on Cbd, he had this kind of amino acids product like muscle stuff with Mike Tyson. I don't think he's really.

194
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:32.030
Copy Accelerator: I think he had like a challenge with Mike as a spokesperson. I don't think he's really running that they're focused more, Tommy Chong. But you know, this did

195
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:40.530
Copy Accelerator: crush the control when I when I wrote it right? And so this is again, a bit more direct response in your face. But we'll get some other examples that I keep mentioning. But

196
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:49.729
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I thought the copy was super cool on this right. Mike Tyson. Professional bombshell. I used to talk about ripping my opponents heart out, but inside I've always felt like a fat, scared little kid.

197
00:21:49.840 --> 00:22:12.510
Copy Accelerator: Here's how the Champ finally reclaimed his manhood, all dropping 83 pounds of retirement weight that had been piling into out of his gut and leaving him sluggish, exhausted, and knocking at death store. And one quick note the promise throughout the copy of that this one is not like that. You'll lose a 3 pounds. But he actually did lose 83 pounds. So it's part of a true story. Just to notate that I was wondering if we did some super black hat thing with Mike Tyson. We didn't. It's just like that was part of his story.

198
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.580
Copy Accelerator: Okay,

199
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:22.790
Copy Accelerator: And so going back to breaking down the building blocks. Really building block number one is just like Mike Tyson, and I mean you, could you could you could add more

200
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:36.329
Copy Accelerator: context. So you could say, You know, it's the idea of Mike Tyson and his prime right or just Mike Tyson either way, and then building block number 2 is like secret and security. So I'm trying. I was almost like, how do I make these building blocks? The most

201
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.240
Copy Accelerator: simple, like

202
00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.939
Copy Accelerator: kind of like like

203
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.350
Copy Accelerator: parts, right? And so it's like.

204
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:57.779
Copy Accelerator: like, Yeah, I get. I could say, Mike Tyson and all the stuff that goes with them by then they might. Tyson's like Super, famous like most would know who my Tyson is. It's really it's the idea of Mike Tyson when and you have your immediate preconceived notions and thoughts and memories of Mike Tyson in general. And for this

205
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.260
Copy Accelerator: market, going back to knowing the market. That's gonna be a bunch of men 40 plus.

206
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.530
Copy Accelerator: When they think of Mike Tyson they think about him.

207
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:15.470
Copy Accelerator: you know. Maybe he's a little bit crazy, but it's one of the best boxes of all time. A lot of them could probably remember, you know, some of his great fights some of the fights where he lost, but, like bit of Evander Holyfield's ear. Off

208
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:27.680
Copy Accelerator: right but like, that's what they're thinking of. And so, you know, maybe a young person thinks of him is like, oh, that guy from the hangover. But that's where knowing your market is really going back to. That is really important, right?

209
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.810
Copy Accelerator: and so really like what makes this a big idea. Work.

210
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:54.510
Copy Accelerator: I think, is like the juxt position between 2 seemingly incongruent things like, what does that mean? Well, it's like, there's an idea that most people, especially in the market, have, with my Tyson in this prime, as like a terrifying, extremely confident, like apex competitor. And then there's this much more relatable idea of someone seeming tough on the outside, but being vulnerable and emotionally scarred on the inside. We're just saying that we can all relate to, and even, you know.

211
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.950
Copy Accelerator: Dudes, who are 40 plus, you know, kind of like.

212
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:03.340
Copy Accelerator: you know, they have insecurities and fears too. Right? Everyone has insecurities and fears, and

213
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:07.740
Copy Accelerator: especially for a man who's who's older. Well, maybe woman, too. But I think men are really, you know.

214
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:14.600
Copy Accelerator: often afraid to to share a lot of those insecurities and private thoughts right like they don't confess as much. They don't talk with their

215
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.019
Copy Accelerator: guy friends about them as much, necessarily.

216
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.409
Copy Accelerator: And so we kind of just combined those 2 ideas into this promo.

217
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.329
Copy Accelerator: So it took people's conception of Mike Tyson and subverted it

218
00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.229
Copy Accelerator: right. That made him suddenly seem more human, more relatable, more like us.

219
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:34.490
Copy Accelerator: And you know this creates a lot of curiosity, of course, and it definitely captures the prospects attention.

220
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.270
Copy Accelerator: But if you go back to making it easier to sell the product.

221
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.420
Copy Accelerator: Well, like, I think, yeah, definitely, it is because, as I wrote

222
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.409
Copy Accelerator: a lot of people's concept, this is what I really thought about when I was writing this lead. And that headline complex is like.

223
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:54.209
Copy Accelerator: you know, you have Mike Tyson as a spokesperson. It seems great, and you can always be like I might, Tyson. I'm really famous. Buy this.

224
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:59.399
Copy Accelerator: But you're selling like a transformation. Right? You're which you're almost always selling the transformation.

225
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:10.979
Copy Accelerator: And the transformation is like, you know, you're gonna lose some weight, gain some muscle, bulk up, have more energy, feel better not bulk up, but just be like more muscular, strong, and like kind of more of like an alpha male. And so

226
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:40.450
Copy Accelerator: if, like Mike Tyson, come like, Hey, this is, gonna you know, make you really like strong like they're like, all right. Well, you're Mike Tyson. So what do you know about this? And even if you're like, oh, I'm Mike Tyson, and you know, after our retire from box they lost weight, or I gained weight, but then I lost it and put muscle back on you. Like, yeah. But you're Mike Tyson. You're like, you're a genetic freak. And, by the way, what I'm doing is actually really important. It's like going back to almost entering the conversation in the prospects. Mind, if you ever heard that concept before, it's like, okay, if I present this idea in this form

227
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.980
Copy Accelerator: to a prospect.

228
00:25:42.010 --> 00:26:08.949
Copy Accelerator: or does somebody to your friend? Right? Go test it with your friends, coworkers, other people like, what are they gonna say, and what objections are they gonna have? And how are they gonna pick this thing apart? And so again, like, you know, Mike Tyson's a generic free. I'm receiving him box in his prime. He was like chiseled, you know. He was like he didn't have an ass to buy fat on him, so like. Of course, Mike Tyson could lose weight really easily and put on muscle. He's Mike fucking Tyson like I'm you know. I'm 55, with a bad back and knee pain, and you know, like.

229
00:26:09.684 --> 00:26:15.650
Copy Accelerator: That's different for me. And so that's why this idea is really powerful of, like the the hidden securities.

230
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:22.059
Copy Accelerator: and really like what the the lead goes on to kind of explain is that, you know he actually struggled

231
00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:42.470
Copy Accelerator: with his weight, his whole life, like right, he actually tortured himself to make weight for his fights. He was like self conscious about it. He used to wear like all these like trash bags, is like just sweat himself out when he was like trying to cut weight and then, you know. Then, after he retired, you know, he put on weight, became a slob. You know, kind of went downhill

232
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:47.139
Copy Accelerator: and you know he's kind of he's just like you, which means a solution that he found can also work for you.

233
00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.610
Copy Accelerator: And so that's like, really like where it becomes really powerful.

234
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.630
Copy Accelerator: And so if I kind of go back to this criteria that I've been sharing.

235
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:57.220
Copy Accelerator: okay. So we talked about building block one Mike Tyson.

236
00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.420
Copy Accelerator: But in block 2 hidden securities the big idea combined together, like

237
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.209
Copy Accelerator: you know. Sort of like.

238
00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:12.449
Copy Accelerator: hey? I'm Mike Tyson, I seem really. And you don't have to. When you do this. You don't need to write this in headline format. Right? It's like, hey? I'm Mike Tyson, and I probably seem really intimidating. And you think about me as this, like.

239
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:17.719
Copy Accelerator: you know, physical specimen. But I actually used to be a fat kid, and I've always been really insecure about my weight.

240
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:23.090
Copy Accelerator: You know, whatever you can just sort of write it out. It's fine, like. Obviously it ends up being in like a headline format, but like

241
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:30.459
Copy Accelerator: big idea, you know, I might taste in you. Think of me as an apex like athlete. But actually, I've always had weight issues and felt really secure about them.

242
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.040
Copy Accelerator: That's a good, nice, easy way to sort of sum it up.

243
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:39.670
Copy Accelerator: So it's really comprehensible, like, yeah, everyone can kind of comprehend or relate to like.

244
00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.139
Copy Accelerator: you know, people perceiving you one way. But you feel a different way inside.

245
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.940
Copy Accelerator: or maybe even feeling like a fat, scared little kid.

246
00:27:46.470 --> 00:28:09.589
Copy Accelerator: Important. We're gonna have a professional bombshell, cause I like it. But you know, it's probably if you're a boxing fan, or Mike Tyson Fan, or, you know, kind of like just someone who's interested in like the T right like it's almost gossipy, like a tabloid headline. Feels important. Think it's same thing that definitely feels exciting like you're like what like Mike Tyson is saying. He used to feel like he always felt like a fat, scared little kid like.

247
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:15.033
Copy Accelerator: you know. And then, you know, is it beneficial? Yeah, especially the

248
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:19.779
Copy Accelerator: you know. Kind of the the the copy does a little bit of heavy lifting on the beneficial component

249
00:28:20.388 --> 00:28:26.320
Copy Accelerator: and I talked about how it, you know, supports the copy and selling the product. Right?

250
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.310
Copy Accelerator: So okay, what we're gonna do in a second

251
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:34.040
Copy Accelerator: is, we're gonna basically like, I have the same format here.

252
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.660
Copy Accelerator: we're gonna look at a bunch of always some different kind of like

253
00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.519
Copy Accelerator: landing pages and some ads and things like that.

254
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.769
Copy Accelerator: And then we're gonna like, basically go through this exercise

255
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:55.159
Copy Accelerator: together a bunch of times, but I am pausing for for some questions and stuff like that, so I see it from Ben does the way you presented the headline as a gospel com story, tie into the big idea, or is that something else?

256
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.560
Copy Accelerator: You know? It's a great question. So I mean the way I would view it is like

257
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:04.170
Copy Accelerator: the headline is like A is a manifestation of the big idea. I mean, the big idea at the end of the day is like

258
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.146
Copy Accelerator: Mike Tyson.

259
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:13.705
Copy Accelerator: again. Seems like this apex athlete, but he's actually always been really insecure and been a fat, little scared, scared little kid inside

260
00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.130
Copy Accelerator: and like.

261
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:24.879
Copy Accelerator: you know, that's sort of like the the crux of the big idea. So the headlines like, how do you manifest that in a way that creates a lot of, you know. Curiosity and

262
00:29:25.249 --> 00:29:31.440
Copy Accelerator: motion captivates most attention. Kind of more heavy lifting to sort of support the big idea. So I guess really

263
00:29:31.857 --> 00:29:33.640
Copy Accelerator: it'd be fair to say like

264
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:42.060
Copy Accelerator: that. They're, you know, the gossip column thing is sort of yeah way to to to present the big idea in a very captivating way. And that's like the.

265
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:46.880
Copy Accelerator: you know, the beauty of copywriting, so to speak, right? That's how we take the big idea and put it into.

266
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.950
Copy Accelerator: you know, a format that's gonna really grab somebody's attention and and get them go like, what?

267
00:29:51.975 --> 00:29:56.469
Copy Accelerator: What other questions do you all have before I keep going here.

268
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:07.532
Copy Accelerator: Don't be shy if you've got any, and I know again this is like the first training of of you know at least 52 right with Ca, pro, you'll be in a a year. Commitment

269
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.450
Copy Accelerator: and obviously

270
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:18.849
Copy Accelerator: you'll have other resources beyond the trainings and all that. But so, you know, if you're hopefully, you're all feeling like that. This is great. I'm right here with you. If you're feeling at all like maybe

271
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.140
Copy Accelerator: a little bit lost or like, okay, like.

272
00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:33.849
Copy Accelerator: I don't know any kind of way, I would say, don't worry too much about that, because obviously, you know, we're gonna keep working together. You're gonna see a lot of concepts over and over again. We're gonna practice stuff implement like there'll be a lot of you know, a lot of will will happen.

273
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.370
Copy Accelerator: But any other questions before I continue on.

274
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.400
Copy Accelerator: Not that's okay.

275
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.460
Copy Accelerator: Alright.

276
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.320
Copy Accelerator: So

277
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.240
Copy Accelerator: I put you to practice. So what I'll do. Here.

278
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.219
Copy Accelerator: let me see if I have this sharing.

279
00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.220
Copy Accelerator: This is viewer like, I'll pop this into the the chat so you can have

280
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.711
Copy Accelerator: your own kind of version of this.

281
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:05.889
Copy Accelerator: now you only have a your view access so you can make a copy of it. I'll definitely will also add this to the members area along with the call replay and recording and all that kind of stuff, but

282
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.860
Copy Accelerator: sharing it so that you all have a copy of it, and I'll actually make myself a copy. That's sort of like a

283
00:31:12.788 --> 00:31:16.000
Copy Accelerator: working copy while we're doing this here.

284
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.600
Copy Accelerator: Make the zoom a bit bigger, too.

285
00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.640
Copy Accelerator: Alright.

286
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.940
Copy Accelerator: So like, let's actually just go through and like.

287
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.059
Copy Accelerator: look at some copy in the wild, so to speak.

288
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.699
Copy Accelerator: And then we can sort of go through this criteria

289
00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.350
Copy Accelerator: together.

290
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.240
Copy Accelerator: So this first one

291
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:39.959
Copy Accelerator: I will trade. I will share the other document with you guys as well

292
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:40.760
Copy Accelerator: is

293
00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:50.419
Copy Accelerator: from like paleo hacks. I was just going through my like. I have a evernote where I just save like links to tons of stuff. So I just kind of pulled random things

294
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.049
Copy Accelerator: alright. So and really, we're just gonna look at

295
00:31:53.150 --> 00:32:02.819
Copy Accelerator: the headlines and and maybe a few lines of copy at most. Because, generally like the big idea should be expressed in the headline, and it will obviously do a whole training or multiple things on headlines and all that. But

296
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.630
Copy Accelerator: for now you understand that so

297
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:13.159
Copy Accelerator: eat chocolate, pancakes, cinnamon waffles, and French toast, drizzle and blueberry syrup breakfast. Yeah. Still, some down with a keto diet.

298
00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.899
Copy Accelerator: Get a low-carb recipes for morning favorites like donuts, muffins, bagels, and more with the brand new keto breakfast cookbook.

299
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.690
Copy Accelerator: Okay, so.

300
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.619
Copy Accelerator: but I can actually copy this a bunch of times that way.

301
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.850
Copy Accelerator: Okay, so

302
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.990
Copy Accelerator: what feel free to put in the chat, or you can shout it out, or whatever like. And what do you all think is like?

303
00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:44.520
Copy Accelerator: what are some of the the elements like we like? I mean, you can either do it like idea number One or I did number 2. But we're trying to find, like the 2

304
00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:46.400
Copy Accelerator: building blocks here, like.

305
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.660
Copy Accelerator: what do you think they are? Feel free to

306
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.740
Copy Accelerator: from in the chatter, or you can say them out loud.

307
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.499
Copy Accelerator: Keto, when he said, Dario Keto.

308
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.460
Copy Accelerator: eat delicious food. Yeah.

309
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.750
Copy Accelerator: Anyone else want to add anything.

310
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.750
Copy Accelerator: Be a decking their breakfast and be in Keto. I'm a nice yeah.

311
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.999
Copy Accelerator: Your favorite foods them down, contrary to preconceived ideas.

312
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.569
Copy Accelerator: Pick out as much as you want, keep losing weight.

313
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:35.725
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, perfect. Perfect. I mean, that's you know, I think pretty much everyone's answers are are different ways of of seeing a pretty similar thing like when I when I looked at it, I mean like that. I I had thought the word decadent, but that's just like there's no, it's not like decadence, the right answer. But I thought, you know kind of like

314
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.230
Copy Accelerator: like a decadent.

315
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.600
Copy Accelerator: like a

316
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.849
Copy Accelerator: decadent like highly status

317
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.469
Copy Accelerator: buying like.

318
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.750
Copy Accelerator: but naughty breakfast, for now right

319
00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:54.060
Copy Accelerator: I mean isn't like, you know, like you should be able to eat that stuff like

320
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.110
Copy Accelerator: and not and not lose weight right? And that's sort of like

321
00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:59.320
Copy Accelerator: yelled.

322
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.190
Copy Accelerator: lose weight

323
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.100
Copy Accelerator: with Keto

324
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.319
Copy Accelerator: right? And so then to what the point like, I think cogal kind of sums this up right? So really, if you combine together, it's like

325
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.550
Copy Accelerator: you know, Pete.

326
00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:17.570
Copy Accelerator: Eileen Deccan!

327
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.049
Copy Accelerator: Breakfast with things like

328
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.116
Copy Accelerator: pancakes waffles

329
00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:29.159
Copy Accelerator: still. Just wait.

330
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:36.640
Copy Accelerator: still be in keto and lose weight. Probably still be in Keto, and

331
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.820
Copy Accelerator: or being ketosis. But whatever?

332
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.560
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So

333
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.249
Copy Accelerator: the video about that is it instantly comprehensible

334
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.249
Copy Accelerator: without sacrifice? Yeah, like that. Ben. Yeah, that's good.

335
00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.229
Copy Accelerator: Right? Yeah.

336
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.419
Copy Accelerator: I would say.

337
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.239
Copy Accelerator: is it important?

338
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.779
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, if you're trying to lose weight? But you got a sweet tooth, or you like to eat decadent meals, or you struggle with the Keto diet.

339
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.340
Copy Accelerator: Is it exciting?

340
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:10.010
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, if you were trying to lose Keto, and you're like I can eat chocolate pancakes and lose weight and stay in Keto

341
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.459
Copy Accelerator: right? Like as a beneficial.

342
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.599
Copy Accelerator: Definitely. Because, you know, we're talking about

343
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:22.340
Copy Accelerator: that, I can essentially have my cake and eat it to pun somewhat intended right? And then,

344
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.430
Copy Accelerator: yeah, does that idea support

345
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:30.930
Copy Accelerator: the copy and selling the product? Well, yeah, I mean, they're selling a keto breakfast cookbook. So it definitely does.

346
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.550
Copy Accelerator: And

347
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.310
Copy Accelerator: one, I think one really important thing I'll I'll point out here is that

348
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:45.328
Copy Accelerator: one thing I've kind of found, or I've been realizing. And I talked about this a bit at our last the live mastermind we had, and

349
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:51.759
Copy Accelerator: We talk about Donny French, who's who's one of the partners of performance golfer, and I'll look at one of their pieces of copy in a second. But

350
00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.669
Copy Accelerator: I found that, like

351
00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:02.598
Copy Accelerator: simple ideas really work, and are so powerful sometimes as copywriters. This is maybe like amusing. But in case it helps somebody

352
00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.880
Copy Accelerator: you know, sometimes we might feel like, we gotta really have.

353
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:10.120
Copy Accelerator: You know this really, I mean even he was like, Oh, like weird breakfast ritual.

354
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.700
Copy Accelerator: you know, lets you

355
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:31.729
Copy Accelerator: eat pancakes, and you know, do whatever like, and and still stay in Keto. It's like, but the the the breakfast ritual was an example. There, right? Like, you see that stuff on like click bank type of offers. It's like there's anything wrong with that. That stuff seems to work, apparently, and it and it does work. But like sometimes, like, you don't need a really now, you not need a really complicated idea. You don't really want one. If you're just like, Hey, you can eat

356
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.199
Copy Accelerator: pancakes and all this decking and stuff. And yet you can stay in Keto and still lose weight

357
00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:42.819
Copy Accelerator: like that's a very simple idea. But somebody immediately grasps it. And really, all that, you know

358
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.629
Copy Accelerator: is happening as you're sort of just taking.

359
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:59.120
Copy Accelerator: I guess, when you combine idea, you're really just taking like what what they already know and stuff they already understand. You're just sort of taking one little twist to it, or one little like change in this case, and still saying Keto, and lose weight

360
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.055
Copy Accelerator: right

361
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:11.529
Copy Accelerator: And so good. My dad's really just like, Hey, these are these 2 ideas. So they're actually in harmony. And that's actually one other really interesting observation to make, too right. If you go back to the Mike Tyson one, it's sort of like

362
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:26.079
Copy Accelerator: it's I talk about being incongruent in a way it seems incongruent right like. Oh, and I guess that's still kind of similar here. So a lot of times like this is not a a an always single big ideas. But it's worth kind of identifying or being interesting that there's like this incongruance

363
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.189
Copy Accelerator: principle. We can say, that's like, if you take 2 things that seeming congruent and say, but they're not.

364
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.615
Copy Accelerator: That's like a very like interesting way of like often coming up with a pretty interesting

365
00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:41.270
Copy Accelerator: big idea. So Mike Tyson is a killer. He's a scared little fat kid in the side

366
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.180
Copy Accelerator: like Susan Congruent. It's actually not

367
00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:51.809
Copy Accelerator: gets your attention right like these are decadent breakfast. You can eat them and still sink. You don't lose weight. Seems it congruent?

368
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.640
Copy Accelerator: Actually, not right?

369
00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:57.839
Copy Accelerator: So yeah, sort of talk through that for a second.

370
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:00.909
Copy Accelerator: Alright, let's look at another one here.

371
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:07.619
Copy Accelerator: This nutrition one I know I've got a lot of neutral stuff. Honestly, I was just point examples I'm happy to. If they want to

372
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:23.630
Copy Accelerator: drop in other examples in the chat. After we get through some of these, like, we can look at others that are non neutral for sure. And, by the way, they might not have big ideas right now everything does. And we'll talk about that at the end of this, too. Not everything has a big idea. Not everything necessarily needs a big idea, generally.

373
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:28.919
Copy Accelerator: between having a big idea and not having a big idea. A big idea is better. But it's not like

374
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.059
Copy Accelerator: if some copy doesn't send a there's copy that can work without a big idea, too. And we'll talk about that at the end.

375
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.710
Copy Accelerator: Okay.

376
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.030
Copy Accelerator: so

377
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:47.850
Copy Accelerator: going back to this one. And this is just like roots, college and super food super charging metabolism and stop aging its tracks with this all in one fat, burning milkshake.

378
00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:52.349
Copy Accelerator: I don't think we have to even go too deep to this on this one. But really, I'll just point out like.

379
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.979
Copy Accelerator: okay, it's like, well, we tell me, what, what are the 2? What are the 2 ideas of this one real quick.

380
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.040
Copy Accelerator: or what are what are you know. Put them in the chat.

381
00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.610
Copy Accelerator: Anyone

382
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.669
Copy Accelerator: milkshake cooking easy to drink. Yep.

383
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.680
Copy Accelerator: Pat Bernie Mokshake.

384
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:34.790
Copy Accelerator: Yeah.

385
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.000
Copy Accelerator: I mean, really, I would just I would if I was gonna just kind of kind of

386
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.049
Copy Accelerator: separate them into 2 parts.

387
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.600
Copy Accelerator: It's just sort of like.

388
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.660
Copy Accelerator: you know.

389
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.510
Copy Accelerator: speeder metabolism

390
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.490
Copy Accelerator: burn fat

391
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.110
Copy Accelerator: like drinking milkshake

392
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.949
Copy Accelerator: right? And it's really just like again, seemingly incongruent.

393
00:39:55.616 --> 00:40:01.030
Copy Accelerator: This is not like a wildly powerful big idea, right? But this is sort of like, yeah, burn fat, was saying this highly delicious like.

394
00:40:01.806 --> 00:40:02.840
Copy Accelerator: You know.

395
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.810
Copy Accelerator: speaker, metabolism.

396
00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.170
Copy Accelerator: fair, fat.

397
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.690
Copy Accelerator: drinking milkshake.

398
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.100
Copy Accelerator: and so

399
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.889
Copy Accelerator: to me, I mean honestly, if I go back to like

400
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.490
Copy Accelerator: this criteria

401
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.710
Copy Accelerator: like.

402
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.852
Copy Accelerator: I just found this in my airflow. I'm not sharing it like at

403
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.279
Copy Accelerator: like. You know I don't. I'm

404
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:25.869
Copy Accelerator: this is like a very often used one, and I'll show you example in a second of what I mean.

405
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:33.570
Copy Accelerator: So it's like, is it comprehensible? Like, yeah, it is. There's still some skepticism there, I mean sitting with the paleo one, too, I guess. But

406
00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.310
Copy Accelerator: you know, is it important?

407
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:42.910
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I don't know. Is there a gut reaction? If you look at this one versus the paleo one we just looked at

408
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.319
Copy Accelerator: right?

409
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:53.449
Copy Accelerator: and maybe part of it's because of the paleo one like they're they're showing you that it's a cookbook right away. So you feel less like skeptical

410
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:54.670
Copy Accelerator: about it.

411
00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:01.529
Copy Accelerator: like you're like, Oh, wow! Like right? But then it's like, you know there's this cookbook that's part of like the kind of whole immediate thing. And so

412
00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:04.009
Copy Accelerator: you can easily go from

413
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.890
Copy Accelerator: feeling skeptical

414
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:12.310
Copy Accelerator: that can do this stuff and stay in Keto and lose weight to like. Okay, cookbook, you know, I know that there's Keto cookbook. So

415
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.419
Copy Accelerator: you know, that kind of makes sense.

416
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.560
Copy Accelerator: whereas with this one

417
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:19.129
Copy Accelerator: like if I look at it.

418
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.640
Copy Accelerator: And I'm like, all right, supercharger metabolism.

419
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.670
Copy Accelerator: But for Faberny Mokshake.

420
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:28.310
Copy Accelerator: I mean, I guess I see this product. This is a college and super food.

421
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:41.049
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. I just I just feel like it doesn't. And maybe this is hard to say I feel. But I'm curious. What did you? I don't want to influence you. Do you guys do any of you kind of understand or have that same intuitive feeling to it, or do you feel like? No, I totally get it. I I want this product

422
00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:48.610
Copy Accelerator: like to me. And maybe you know, it's a specificity with this one, too. But to me I feel like this one I don't like have the the same exact like.

423
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.130
Copy Accelerator: But is it exciting again? Like.

424
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.640
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I guess if this mokshake really does those things like, sure.

425
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.880
Copy Accelerator: But it's like, not really emotion, because I can see it's super food here.

426
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.500
Copy Accelerator: beneficial. Yeah. But I mean, of course, that'd be beneficial.

427
00:42:03.955 --> 00:42:06.240
Copy Accelerator: And it does. Yeah, it does sell the

428
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.609
Copy Accelerator: like. A milkshake does help sell the product.

429
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.640
Copy Accelerator: But

430
00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.050
Copy Accelerator: you know.

431
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:26.509
Copy Accelerator: Andre said. He thinks that the stop aging thing is like exciting. Yeah, I agree. But even that's tough, because it's like, is it about found of youth? Stop aging, but it's like well, which one is it? Is it metabolism and fat, burning milkshake? Or is it stop aging thing? There's sort of 2 ideas

432
00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.269
Copy Accelerator: mixed together in this.

433
00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:39.148
Copy Accelerator: It's not the end of the road. But I I generally would want like one main big idea like, or or even one big like benefit pain point within the embedded within the the big idea.

434
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.110
Copy Accelerator: And so you know.

435
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.530
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I don't know. It's interesting, Daria said.

436
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.330
Copy Accelerator: It's possible outproof. While the cookbook

437
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.949
Copy Accelerator: had the proof embedded in some way.

438
00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.470
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I mean, I think just the fact that it's a cookbook is like a proof element, because you're like, okay, like, you know.

439
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:20.920
Copy Accelerator: Mark said. That's what I thought as well. The ideas are crossing over each other here you have metabolism, plantation, papering, and college and super food. Yeah, I agree. And so I found, I think I found this one in my somebody like, I'm on a bunch of email lists. So I'll get them, and then I'll click on links, and if I see some a pages interesting, for whatever reason, I'll save it. But I mean, I have no idea how this you know, I could go find it, use a spy tool.

440
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:37.890
Copy Accelerator: But going back to that right? What Mark just said, even if you scroll down. This is going a little bit off the big idea thing. But hopefully you don't mind you indulging in the adventure. It's kind of coming down here, the real power of collagen like skin, health, hair, health, nail, growth, joint, health, bone, health got health fat, burning right? And it's kind of like.

441
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.510
Copy Accelerator: So what are we trying to do here? Like? Generally like with like copy, like again, you want to have sort of like

442
00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:53.569
Copy Accelerator: route number one. This is the main pain point. This is the main promise. Relate to that pain point, and it doesn't mean you wouldn't talk about other things. But, like you, probably what I would do if I were going to be

443
00:43:53.890 --> 00:44:05.194
Copy Accelerator: bye, Sandy, if I was, gonna be copy sheeping, this would be like to really figure out, okay, is this anti aging, or is it weight, loss, and fat burning, and which one is the primary focus? And I could still be like, you know, later on like

444
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.510
Copy Accelerator: And then, by the way, you can do headlines like, you know.

445
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.010
Copy Accelerator: here's a story of like, how

446
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.466
Copy Accelerator: you know, how did that?

447
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.319
Copy Accelerator: Or like, how like? Why, why, women swear

448
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.619
Copy Accelerator: so they're they're they're

449
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:31.803
Copy Accelerator: it looks like they're aging 10 like, why does someone say they're they're aging tenure or Chinese compliantly. Why, why does it like? Why does someone swear? That drinking the smokeshake

450
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.180
Copy Accelerator: Seems to, you know, help them

451
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:43.910
Copy Accelerator: look like 10 years younger or something like that. That's not that strong, but essentially like you're casting really specific on anti-aging. And you guys saying, really specific on a

452
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.480
Copy Accelerator: on fat burning, too.

453
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:51.699
Copy Accelerator: But and so actually going back to the criteria like, that's where it's helpful if you if you sort of going through this, and you sort of feel like.

454
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:59.659
Copy Accelerator: And I don't know if this was your own kind of complex. If you're trying to think through a big idea or the copy that you've written. It doesn't really like, you know.

455
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.020
Copy Accelerator: Does it really

456
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.809
Copy Accelerator: convey the big idea? He might sit there and be like.

457
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:09.359
Copy Accelerator: like, I'm not sure that's a good sign. Maybe there's things you can do to make it better or stronger.

458
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:20.347
Copy Accelerator: Isn't this idea of lose weight without having to point any effort, have about struggling use, but almost every weight loss supplement. Aren't people becoming more skeptical when seeing those types of big promises?

459
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:28.340
Copy Accelerator: I don't know if they are not. I mean, I think it depends on the marketing. Like, I know I'm fatigued seeing them.

460
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.510
Copy Accelerator: but you do also see.

461
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:36.300
Copy Accelerator: You know. You see them continue to be used, and like sort of offers and funnels that are

462
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.680
Copy Accelerator: having success. So

463
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:43.440
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. I don't know if you are fatigued on that, or if they're more fatigued on like

464
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.589
Copy Accelerator: rituals and things of that nature, you know, I mean.

465
00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.350
Copy Accelerator: probably I'm supposed to say this right, but for the the pet supplement that I'm partnered in.

466
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:58.960
Copy Accelerator: whatever. Yeah. So like. Like Brad Howard is a partner in that now, too, and he runs like Java Burn and a bunch of other stuff.

467
00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:07.280
Copy Accelerator: I really I don't know what should say on this call. But basically they're doing like Job has been out for a while, and he said that they have this like a couple of new mega affiliates, and and they're doing

468
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.830
Copy Accelerator: like way over a thousand sales a day right now, right? And

469
00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.670
Copy Accelerator: so I bring that up just because it's like.

470
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:27.939
Copy Accelerator: yeah, that offer has been around for a while. And so it's really about traffic. I don't know. It's like people do, or I mean, I'm doing Peptides some of glue tide things like that which is really the promise of like heaven without hell, so to speak. So I don't know. I think the promise is still there.

471
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:33.509
Copy Accelerator: And so until I basically, I would be like until the market proves that

472
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.090
Copy Accelerator: they've really changed.

473
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.939
Copy Accelerator: like, you know, you would kind of still go that route. That doesn't mean to say, Hey, lose 85 pounds about doing anything like I've written tons of copy where it's like.

474
00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:57.330
Copy Accelerator: you know, like, Hey, of course, you know, diet exercise are important, but this thing can really help give you a boost right? This is like, especially especially if you combine of diet exercise like wow, like, right like. And so really, that comes back to like, you know, compliance, what you're doing, what you're selling that to see the product, all that kind of stuff, too.

475
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.970
Copy Accelerator: yeah, Ben, isn't that where the mechanism comes in

476
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.010
Copy Accelerator: to overcome sighs of that skepticism.

477
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.739
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, and it is often too

478
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.139
Copy Accelerator: so I guess so alright, so

479
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:21.279
Copy Accelerator: so going back to the milkshake thing, though, like right, this is from like Emma relief. And they have, like this Keto activate thing, conscious Keto.

480
00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:26.730
Copy Accelerator: And so this page is beautiful. By the way I'm gonna give you a document. If you've never seen this page, I love this

481
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:28.570
Copy Accelerator: because it's really like a

482
00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:34.659
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I would call it so it's like a hybrid page like it looks like an Ecom page right above the fold, as they say.

483
00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.070
Copy Accelerator: So basically like

484
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.010
Copy Accelerator: you're looking at it here. It looks like like a nice, clean Ecom page.

485
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:43.550
Copy Accelerator: The design is great if you start scrolling down at this page

486
00:47:43.780 --> 00:48:07.199
Copy Accelerator: new something chocolate promotes Keto without the frustrations. And it's like my name is Dr. Melissa Newman. I got my doctorate from the University of Louisville, and I'm currently professor a research user university in Ohio. I've taught for 12 years most of nutritionist and survive fat lost coach. The reason I'm here is not because of anything I learned in school and said something. I learned the hard way through personal experience, and although painful, embarrassing, my story. Oh, wait! Is this starting to turn into a sales letter is important here, because it shows

487
00:48:07.442 --> 00:48:27.349
Copy Accelerator: just making one tiny change and eating actually made the difference between my body burning fat or holding onto it. After I first shot. I struggled with weight loss before that I was very active, and never had any problems with my weight. How the fat came on later in life suddenly, like how 85 being 85 pounds over weight led to unusual discovery. And so I love this page because again, it's like very like nicely designed. You sort of like.

488
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:35.500
Copy Accelerator: go to it. You're like, Oh, yeah, like, you know, it feels like an an Ecom thing right? But then, as you kind of. It's got the mechanism. It's basically like a a sales letter

489
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.670
Copy Accelerator: dressed up.

490
00:48:37.505 --> 00:48:38.250
Copy Accelerator: As

491
00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.900
Copy Accelerator: like a.

492
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.410
Copy Accelerator: you know, kind of

493
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:54.636
Copy Accelerator: as an Ecom page. But it's actually quite long. So I love this page saying, like, I actually did, a training should be in the members area for how to use Claude to kind of write pages like this, so I can link to that circle.

494
00:48:55.100 --> 00:49:00.449
Copy Accelerator: But the reason I wanted to to go through it right now, if this one is because we go back to the the milkshake.

495
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:05.530
Copy Accelerator: It's sort of like the same concept here. I mean, this literally looks like a mokshake right? And so it's like.

496
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.710
Copy Accelerator: unleash the fat, releasing power of Keto with a deliciously creamy chocolate. Drink

497
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:17.229
Copy Accelerator: brand new flood your body with ketones supercharged your metabolism, reduce cravings, improvemental focus, ethic performance, and more

498
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:20.290
Copy Accelerator: and so

499
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:23.919
Copy Accelerator: like, if we go back to our big idea voter here.

500
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.909
Copy Accelerator: it's a really similar

501
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:31.009
Copy Accelerator: mechanism or not mechanism up like kind of big idea elements as well. Right? It's sort of like.

502
00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:36.199
Copy Accelerator: But I guess the difference would be back to Keto right? So if you if you're gonna do the building blocks for this one.

503
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:37.380
Copy Accelerator: what would you put?

504
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:45.850
Copy Accelerator: Don't be shy.

505
00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:58.370
Copy Accelerator: And again, you think about just like the simplest elements of it, right? So

506
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.300
Copy Accelerator: how many of you guys aren't doing it? Because you're because you're confused because you're like feeling so basic, you don't want to do it.

507
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:10.190
Copy Accelerator: So I can just do it instead, I guess. But basically there we go. See?

508
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.580
Copy Accelerator: Lucia.

509
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:18.379
Copy Accelerator: Big idea building block number one, delicious creamy chocolate drink, big idea building block number 2, battery cinquito. Yeah, perfect.

510
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.820
Copy Accelerator: That's good. Right?

511
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:23.960
Copy Accelerator: combining them together, you know

512
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.030
Copy Accelerator: this delicious creamy chocolate drink can

513
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:32.979
Copy Accelerator: help you to, you know, achieve, to to get to maximize or achieve the fat, releasing power of keto.

514
00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:34.435
Copy Accelerator: Okay,

515
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.460
Copy Accelerator: it's really that simple.

516
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.470
Copy Accelerator: It's comprehensible. Yeah.

517
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:41.919
Copy Accelerator: does it feel important?

518
00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:46.860
Copy Accelerator: You know. Same thing there, it's important to like the person I mean.

519
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.890
Copy Accelerator: That's where like, if you have like, some breaking new discovery type of thing like.

520
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:59.560
Copy Accelerator: But again, there's sort of the the fine line of like does that become too clickbait feeling, or too like too bullshit feeling. But, like, you know, it's pretty important.

521
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:04.999
Copy Accelerator: exciting same thing. I'd like it to like a skill of one to 10

522
00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.350
Copy Accelerator: like. So it's like, you know, if I was gonna like instantly comprehensible. 10.

523
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.480
Copy Accelerator: Right? Important.

524
00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.899
Copy Accelerator: I mean, if I'm trying to lose weight. And I like.

525
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.069
Copy Accelerator: I'm putting like a 6 for me. Personally, this is subjective, exciting.

526
00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680
Copy Accelerator: 6

527
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.440
Copy Accelerator: beneficial

528
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:23.659
Copy Accelerator: like a 9 or a 10. Right? Something like that. Basically like.

529
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.130
Copy Accelerator: obviously.

530
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:33.090
Copy Accelerator: if I can, you know, do that with this like chocolate. Honestly, the product image goes a long way. If I see it's dark chocolate truffle, and there's like little truffles here, and like

531
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:36.480
Copy Accelerator: chocolate, dark chocolate bars here like you know

532
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.589
Copy Accelerator: you what it is about the design element, I think. Really, it's like, if you look at this one

533
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:47.369
Copy Accelerator: and you really look at the Proct image and that drink I'm like, Oh, I want to fucking. Drink that right. And then you look at like the chocolate. Oh, I want to eat that.

534
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.150
Copy Accelerator: and if I go back to Paleo hacks.

535
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.320
Copy Accelerator: I'm like.

536
00:51:50.750 --> 00:52:08.200
Copy Accelerator: you know, like as I said, the surfy thing back there, and I'm like that looks good. And I guess this. You know the pancakes there, I'm like, I wanna eat those muffins like, you know, especially if I'm hungry if I'm dieting and I'm trying to lose weight. And I see this stuff, and I'm like, I wanna eat it. And then it's like, Hey, you can, you know, or you could drink it. And if I do this one.

537
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:16.149
Copy Accelerator: that's just a product, they would, you know they would do. And this is where I mean, this is kind of cool. I don't know if this hopefully, I'm not just free selling, and you'll think I'm going on adventures. But I would

538
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:24.370
Copy Accelerator: like, what is this cup of like milk right? It's like if they had a picture of like a delicious looking like milkshake, like a vanilla milkshake with whipped cream and stuff on it

539
00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.350
Copy Accelerator: right like a straw coming out of it

540
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.509
Copy Accelerator: like that alone might make me like

541
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:35.970
Copy Accelerator: way more. Maybe some vanilla leaf like that vanilla leaf that's on the product image like next to this, like delicious looking milkshake of a straw coming out.

542
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.260
Copy Accelerator: I'd be way more into that copy.

543
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:48.710
Copy Accelerator: It's really interesting, right? But that's really like. So again, the big idea is important, but it kind of shows you the element of the 2 things was like the big idea that are 3 things where the headline like the design. And so

544
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.549
Copy Accelerator: you go to the design of this one. Where again I'm like, Oh, my God! And the whole thing looks great, you know, kind of just like aesthetically, but like

545
00:52:56.190 --> 00:53:00.409
Copy Accelerator: that versus that, you know this page is done tens of millions of dollars

546
00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:03.500
Copy Accelerator: last year. I don't know if this thing is done well at all.

547
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:06.860
Copy Accelerator: and it's not. That's like the only thing. But that's definitely an element

548
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:08.350
Copy Accelerator: so

549
00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:11.340
Copy Accelerator: kind of cool kind of cool stuff there.

550
00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:19.060
Copy Accelerator: Okay, here's that the pet one partner and I hate the design of this page. We just went live recently. It's actually doing decently. But

551
00:53:20.874 --> 00:53:24.109
Copy Accelerator: I provide copy you get on calls. I'm not as much

552
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:31.340
Copy Accelerator: in the weeds again for the Peptide Company, so don't judge me because I'm already like, we need to redesign. This page is hideous.

553
00:53:32.207 --> 00:53:35.009
Copy Accelerator: Hate everything about the design. But

554
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:44.479
Copy Accelerator: Russ is from Facebook, primarily and an email to you, actually a lot of email. And then we're just starting to do some Facebook traffic more. So for

555
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.688
Copy Accelerator: wild belly, which is like the like a probiotic sort of like longevity supplement. And then,

556
00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:58.120
Copy Accelerator: this one, it's been primarily Facebook. But you know, most of our traffic and sales so far have been email. And then we're trying to get Facebook going. Other verticals, too.

557
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.650
Copy Accelerator: so even though

558
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:05.249
Copy Accelerator: this is very simple, if we go back to our criteria here

559
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.569
Copy Accelerator: for this one.

560
00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.913
Copy Accelerator: And I wrote this letter.

561
00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.440
Copy Accelerator: but again.

562
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:19.030
Copy Accelerator: okay. Leading veterinarian researcher says these 2 missing fats are behind your dogs, painful if he joins not aging.

563
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.369
Copy Accelerator: And like that's really, you know, is missing fats. Okay? So

564
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:30.340
Copy Accelerator: what would you look at as, the building blocks, we're gonna do at least one more.

565
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:32.789
Copy Accelerator: maybe a couple more. But

566
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.950
Copy Accelerator: somebody. Let's somebody do it.

567
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.139
Copy Accelerator: Be the brave person

568
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.629
Copy Accelerator: missing fast and not aging, said Ben.

569
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:08.800
Copy Accelerator: missing fats, achy dog joints aging common problem, missing fats.

570
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:11.280
Copy Accelerator: Cool? Thanks. Guys.

571
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.140
Copy Accelerator: yeah. I mean, I would say, it's like.

572
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.219
Copy Accelerator: I actually purposely didn't try to think about this one too much

573
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:22.259
Copy Accelerator: Moni joint pain is normally related to aging, and there's no thing you can do about that.

574
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:23.960
Copy Accelerator: Yeah.

575
00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:30.410
Copy Accelerator: I'm sure 2 would be. But you can. There's missing fats. Right? I do one dog taking joints. I do. 2. It's not what you think.

576
00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.920
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I mean, I think to me the big idea.

577
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.900
Copy Accelerator: And again. This is not meditated

578
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:52.779
Copy Accelerator: so Russ, I think you wanna a little bit late. The idea here is like, not that the headline is the big idea, but the headline would be a manifestation of the big idea. So you have your big idea, and then, like you are like your headline should represent that and communicate that big idea and kind of paint a picture of it. And so

579
00:55:54.004 --> 00:56:11.349
Copy Accelerator: yeah, for sure. Right? So yeah, I think, like, if if I'm like, you know. Hey, there's these 2 missing faster behind. Where's what I said, these 2 missing faster behind your dogs. People like you join. So it's like constituent. One might be like, you do it. Another order, frankly right? But like kind of like missing fats.

580
00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.960
Copy Accelerator: and then idea, too, would be like, you know.

581
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.000
Copy Accelerator: your dogs!

582
00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.790
Copy Accelerator: Painful joints.

583
00:56:22.570 --> 00:56:26.700
Copy Accelerator: And yeah, we've got not aging, I mean, could have you want to put like a block? 3 of not aging.

584
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.120
Copy Accelerator: I go through like joint pain.

585
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.030
Copy Accelerator: and dogs like

586
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:37.900
Copy Accelerator: you can do this man missing fats are good.

587
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:41.740
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. There have to be that concurrent right?

588
00:56:42.345 --> 00:56:46.870
Copy Accelerator: So that'll show like what I have here. It's too missing fast behind your dogs painfully. You can join that 18

589
00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.440
Copy Accelerator: like

590
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:52.630
Copy Accelerator: you can also almost do. The inverses, like

591
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.260
Copy Accelerator: dogs need

592
00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.440
Copy Accelerator: 2 fats.

593
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.440
Copy Accelerator: but don't get them.

594
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:09.850
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. I don't know. I'm actually just. I like seeing myself struggle for a second, we go back to what Bill said. Dogs, joints.

595
00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:14.130
Copy Accelerator: missing fats, aching, dog joins. I kind of like Mark had the most honestly.

596
00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:15.519
Copy Accelerator: let me go back to that

597
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:16.960
Copy Accelerator: missing fats.

598
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.600
Copy Accelerator: taking joints and dogs.

599
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:25.240
Copy Accelerator: and it's sort of like, you know again. Then, because if you combine them together the like.

600
00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.920
Copy Accelerator: Oh, 2, it's too missing.

601
00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.589
Copy Accelerator: Bats lead to

602
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:34.859
Copy Accelerator: taking joints, dogs right?

603
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:45.429
Copy Accelerator: And there's something to be said again, as I'm just sort of obviously you guys with the replays and and we'll we'll, you know we'll go over tons of stuff. I don't want to feel like I want to feel like I'm I'm just.

604
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:53.125
Copy Accelerator: I don't know I can't. It's like, I want to cover everything in a single call. But it's like it's a year's worth of stuff. Ultimately we're going to go through right

605
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.800
Copy Accelerator: But like

606
00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:01.970
Copy Accelerator: I still could drop gems because I can't help myself right? And so one of those is always like a a simple thing like often going back to like a culprit like

607
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:06.542
Copy Accelerator: like we talked about like a juxtition before, right of, like the Mike Tyson, one or the

608
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:12.075
Copy Accelerator: the whatever the other one was. But it's not always about exposition.

609
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:14.250
Copy Accelerator: right? It's not sort of like.

610
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.799
Copy Accelerator: you know. This case is sort of is sort of

611
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:31.930
Copy Accelerator: this. One thing is missing. Right? Add this one thing to your diet, or or and again, it's too missing fast. But it's 1 one thing is missing. It's these 2 missing fats, right? Like there's sort of just one really simple thing that's not working right now. And that's like the real cause of the problem

612
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.660
Copy Accelerator: that's like, always really powerful and works. And that's true of like health. Again, it's like.

613
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.250
Copy Accelerator: if I go to biz OP, for example, right? It's like.

614
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:54.304
Copy Accelerator: you know, you tried drop shipping on Amazon and Yada Yada Yada. But like, basically, there's this one thing you haven't been doing when you set up your you know Fba account and that's really like the difference one, you know. One thing that you should be doing to get clients that you're not right.

615
00:58:54.780 --> 00:59:10.929
Copy Accelerator: that's like sort of like going back to like things that just work again and again and again. You know, that's sort of like really powerful by market. Why did you highlight not aging and not aching, Joyce? Because I hate the design. I didn't highlight shit. It was just like our designers. Just

616
00:59:11.368 --> 00:59:15.419
Copy Accelerator: like, I hate this page like I was saying so. I mean, if you wanna talk about

617
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:28.760
Copy Accelerator: okay, I wanna put a product image up here. But I don't really like this weird Paul with a red, glowing light. It's okay. Frankly, it's actually takes up a ton of real estate if you look at all this space here. So I go back to like above the fold, especially on Mobile. Right? Let's inspect it

618
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:30.070
Copy Accelerator: on

619
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:31.960
Copy Accelerator: Mobile

620
00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:40.660
Copy Accelerator: like. So this would be considered like right. Anything that you have to scroll that you don't have to scroll for is considered above the fold. Anything that you do have to scroll for

621
00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.599
Copy Accelerator: is considered below the fold. And so right now

622
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.070
Copy Accelerator: it's like

623
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:54.970
Copy Accelerator: a headline, a picture of a dog with like a red like laser beam on his paw, and then at the very bottom, there's like a little bit of copy right? And you have to scroll. So

624
00:59:55.040 --> 01:00:05.010
Copy Accelerator: there's just a lot of elements to this page that the designs like horrible about. And so soon as I saw it was like, Hey, we gotta. There's a lot of stuff we need to fix first and foremost, being

625
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.750
Copy Accelerator: this stuff above default.

626
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.190
Copy Accelerator: Now.

627
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.526
Copy Accelerator: surprise that

628
01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:15.969
Copy Accelerator: it's actually not as bad as you as you keep going like the design becomes like overall better.

629
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:20.030
Copy Accelerator: but

630
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:24.209
Copy Accelerator: it's not great, but it's like not. But above the fold is especially brutal.

631
01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.220
Copy Accelerator: I mean I get? Yeah, Armand answered. You know, because the misconception is about aging like that's true.

632
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:35.340
Copy Accelerator: But

633
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:43.939
Copy Accelerator: I don't know. I'm not sure if I would have highlighted, not using versus if he joins. I don't know. I mean I get you're right. I mean, that's why they did it. I'm not sure if I if I

634
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.100
Copy Accelerator: love it or not.

635
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:50.270
Copy Accelerator: Alright! Let's look at this a couple more real quick here, perfect. I got 2 more. I think so. It's not a big deal.

636
01:00:50.860 --> 01:01:00.149
Copy Accelerator: Not, you know. We won't take here forever, as we're trying to say. By the way, Zoom could come through something called Swipe Builder, which is pretty cool. It's not free. This guy.

637
01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:07.450
Copy Accelerator: I guess he's really super anonymous on he's on Twitter his Wi-fi money guy. He actually came to the first Ca probe and never back in

638
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.399
Copy Accelerator: 2,019. He's been an affiliate, all of that. But he basically created this cool tool called swipe builder.

639
01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:26.259
Copy Accelerator: I'm not like an affiliate for anything that I forget what the cost is, but for you know, the business owners on this call, or for those of you who might want to tell your company. Hey? I want to get this, or if you just want to get yourself whatever I don't think it's crazy expensive. It's got like an extension, too. So it's really cool.

640
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:29.150
Copy Accelerator: If you go to Ads library

641
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:34.090
Copy Accelerator: and go like you know, all ads whatever. And like, I was like, you know, doing this earlier, right

642
01:01:34.598 --> 01:01:40.259
Copy Accelerator: for Gundry, like, you'll see their ads right? And the video and that. But do you guys press swipe.

643
01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:43.029
Copy Accelerator: And basically, then

644
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.850
Copy Accelerator: what happens is

645
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:47.059
Copy Accelerator: it takes any of those ads.

646
01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:51.799
Copy Accelerator: and it brings them here into like swipe builder for you, which is pretty convenient, right? And then

647
01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:56.500
Copy Accelerator: also you can. You can categorize and put them in like folders, inspect, swipe.

648
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.419
Copy Accelerator: and it can like tell you

649
01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:02.889
Copy Accelerator: data like on them sometimes as well. You go to the Mobile landing page.

650
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:16.319
Copy Accelerator: the desktop page that it goes to other things like that stats this one just started. There's no stats but for older ones. And then it actually even transcribes the entire thing. So this is like the Vsl cause Gundry runs and feed vs.

651
01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:24.549
Copy Accelerator: vsl is ads like in in like, you know, the stream. So it actually transcribes the entire thing for you, too, which actually comes in super handy for

652
01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.762
Copy Accelerator: AI type of stuff and doesn't just do for Facebook either. It does it. For like, for example, for Tiktok, I've been researching

653
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:35.379
Copy Accelerator: like 2035 year old weight loss stuff. Give me a second here.

654
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.869
Copy Accelerator: I know you can't hear the audio 1 s. Let me switch it. So place for my computer.

655
01:02:40.605 --> 01:02:51.999
Copy Accelerator: We actually need to go through chat too much right now. But but the point is, I can just press swipe right. And then this is just like an actual Tiktok video. But same thing. It actually goes and gets saved

656
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.300
Copy Accelerator: and swipe over to. And then they actually have an AI thing that will like write.

657
01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.450
Copy Accelerator: you know, new ads and things like that based off of it. So it's pretty cool.

658
01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:04.509
Copy Accelerator: These are other people who have been swiping things lately. It's funny

659
01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:14.274
Copy Accelerator: Brian Speranella, who's been pro was pro for a long time wrote most of lost it for happy mammoth, but to go back to our swipe file. So I just see I just save that one.

660
01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.659
Copy Accelerator: Let's look at like these Gundry ones real quick and this first one

661
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.869
Copy Accelerator: we find. Let me actually

662
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.080
Copy Accelerator: make this a little bit smaller

663
01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:24.740
Copy Accelerator: of.

664
01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.320
Copy Accelerator: okay, so you should be able to hear the audio on this

665
01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:34.240
Copy Accelerator: may wear these gut destroyers. Sorry I'll make this water 1 s guys my head my head, but doesn't turn off. I don't think

666
01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.490
Copy Accelerator: one sec

667
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.359
Copy Accelerator: can't have you miss out on the fart? Sounds that'd be terrible. Make sure everyone.

668
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.460
Copy Accelerator: Let's wait for these fart sounds.

669
01:03:45.970 --> 01:03:49.120
Copy Accelerator: Grady. Beware of these gut destroyers.

670
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:57.000
Copy Accelerator: and knowing what makes a good fart or a bad fart starts in the foods you eat. Take broccoli and cauliflower, for instance.

671
01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:10.813
Copy Accelerator: these cruciferous vegetables are packed with fiber and nutrients that our bodies need. When we consume them, our gut bacteria break them down, which is a process that creates gas. Put you to pause right there, because I know it doesn't necessarily.

672
01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.090
Copy Accelerator: you might. You might not have realized it.

673
01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.660
Copy Accelerator: But really

674
01:04:17.530 --> 01:04:19.659
Copy Accelerator: The big idea for like this ad

675
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:23.420
Copy Accelerator: is like you can hear right? You guys can't hear it. Gary, I said, for good

676
01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.840
Copy Accelerator: like

677
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.410
Copy Accelerator: really is like the first

678
01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.139
Copy Accelerator: kind of 2 sentences, and maybe it's a little more implied.

679
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.531
Copy Accelerator: I'll kind of do this one for you right, but it's sort of like the idea of like

680
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:40.810
Copy Accelerator: like, yeah, good far some bad farts, I mean perfect good job, right? And so sort of like.

681
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:45.700
Copy Accelerator: you know, this idea of like, there's it's really just that there's good farts, and there's bad farts. And so

682
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:50.960
Copy Accelerator: really, I mean, honestly ideal. One good farts idea, 2 bad farts. Or maybe it's like ideal one

683
01:04:51.648 --> 01:04:54.040
Copy Accelerator: farting idea to like.

684
01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.735
Copy Accelerator: what you eat.

685
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.080
Copy Accelerator: like, yeah.

686
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:07.329
Copy Accelerator: your health like like I, an easy way to measure your health right? You can sort of measure your health by.

687
01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.410
Copy Accelerator: If your fart's good or bad, I don't know something like that like

688
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.870
Copy Accelerator: I'm trying to play. I'm trying. I mean, I'm doing this sort of live because I didn't want to overly meditate on it.

689
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:18.510
Copy Accelerator: but like

690
01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.630
Copy Accelerator: so you'd assume

691
01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.519
Copy Accelerator: like those are. Give me like broccoli and and cauliflower good farts.

692
01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:33.060
Copy Accelerator: I mean, honestly, maybe it's as simple as like, well, so I want to say, like, it's something as simple as like good farts, bad farts.

693
01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.860
Copy Accelerator: But the question. And it sounds funny you're talking about farce.

694
01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:45.269
Copy Accelerator: But if you can combine those together right, you don't necessarily see like that doesn't make sense. There are good farts and bad parts. There are good parts.

695
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:47.610
Copy Accelerator: So really it's like

696
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.820
Copy Accelerator: parts.

697
01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.698
Copy Accelerator: and I guess I don't know what was one part to be. I don't have any ideas. It'd be like

698
01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:02.010
Copy Accelerator: you know

699
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:08.482
Copy Accelerator: what you eat.

700
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.630
Copy Accelerator: you know, dictates

701
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.069
Copy Accelerator: how you feel, and maybe it's that

702
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.280
Copy Accelerator: right. And so sort of like

703
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:21.299
Copy Accelerator: what you, what you eat to taste your your health. You are what you eat

704
01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:24.510
Copy Accelerator: right?

705
01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:26.200
Copy Accelerator: And so sort of like.

706
01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.250
Copy Accelerator: be good food is, you'll have

707
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.710
Copy Accelerator: good farts.

708
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.980
Copy Accelerator: and if you eat bad foods you'll have

709
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:42.580
Copy Accelerator: bad farts.

710
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:45.406
Copy Accelerator: That's sort of it.

711
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.080
Copy Accelerator: 8.

712
01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.460
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I agree, Ben. Good. Call right? Also juxtaposition of like

713
01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.669
Copy Accelerator: farts are bad, and then, oh, some Fars can be good.

714
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:00.970
Copy Accelerator: right?

715
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:07.470
Copy Accelerator: so yeah, I don't know. This is, this is like where this tool or this little framework is is sort of

716
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.919
Copy Accelerator: it's something to get to play around with, and it gets you thinking about the copy. More.

717
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:19.500
Copy Accelerator: I mean, if I think about it, is like, okay, like, is that comprehensible that there's good farts and bad farts like, yeah, the total, it totally is. So it's interesting, and never I never. I've seen that before.

718
01:07:19.610 --> 01:07:20.930
Copy Accelerator: Oh, yeah, makes sense.

719
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:35.800
Copy Accelerator: you know. I mean, obviously, you could sort of like, even do other angles or variations of this right is like, and I've seen this a little bit more. But like, why does some far smell terrible? And some don't smell at all right? Like, obviously, it's immediately it's almost paradoxical. Another way. You could sort of position this.

720
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:40.660
Copy Accelerator: but yeah, it's instantly comprehensible. Is it important?

721
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:54.089
Copy Accelerator: oh, I guess you know kind of again, if you're into I the important thing is almost a complied and like, if you're watching this, and you're interested in gut health. And it's kind of important to you. Is it? Exciting? Kind of, I mean, fart sounds exciting. Gives you kind of

722
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:55.620
Copy Accelerator: locked in.

723
01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:04.439
Copy Accelerator: And is it beneficial? Yeah, I mean, I think people again, if you're interested in your health, then it's beneficial. And it's gonna lock you in. And especially for an ad, right? Because then it turns into the whole Vsl. But really like

724
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:14.170
Copy Accelerator: this could be the opening of any ad. It could be the opening of like a 2 min ad or 1 min ad like, that's why I wanted to kind of show a couple of add examples, because, like, it's not like something where I really, it's like a hook, right? But it's sort of like

725
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:20.350
Copy Accelerator: we'll talk more about hooks and and and a future call by the next call. May one more big ideas next call but like.

726
01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:25.179
Copy Accelerator: you know, cause I guess, like, what's the difference between a big idea on a hook. And it's like the difference is.

727
01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.119
Copy Accelerator: you've got a lot of hooks, but only one big idea.

728
01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.630
Copy Accelerator: right? So

729
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:35.990
Copy Accelerator: you know, arguably, ads will focus on hooks more than big ideas. But I still want to show you how you could like take.

730
01:08:36.490 --> 01:08:42.630
Copy Accelerator: you know, that same criteria, and look at sort of a hook, or like the big idea of an ad, so to speak, like, and

731
01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.239
Copy Accelerator: you know, evaluate it. Let's look at one more

732
01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:46.510
Copy Accelerator: from Gundry.

733
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.859
Copy Accelerator: and it was this gluten one here.

734
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.949
Copy Accelerator: So hit play on this.

735
01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.319
Copy Accelerator: What does Gluten do to the body?

736
01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:57.440
Copy Accelerator: See, gluten is a natural plant.

737
01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:00.590
Copy Accelerator: Sorry I'm trying to get bigger. So the heck happened to that.

738
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:05.219
Copy Accelerator: What does Gluten do to the body?

739
01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:32.140
Copy Accelerator: See, gluten is a natural plant, protein you'll find in a lot of grains. It's what give bread and other products that gluey chewiness. Now, if you've tested positive for celiac or gluten intolerance, eating gluten may cause reactions like bloating fatigue, indigestion, and constipation as a doctor, I recommend anyone with this allergy to unquestionably avoid gluten.

740
01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:45.209
Copy Accelerator: However, my research, in addition to several other trusted sources, suggest only 1% of Americans are affected by celiac. And yet 33% buy these pricey gluten free products.

741
01:09:45.210 --> 01:09:56.469
Copy Accelerator: Now, the other 32% may feel better because they are actually avoiding a different plant protein, which means gluten is often not the true problem.

742
01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:58.999
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So that was a little bit longer.

743
01:09:59.581 --> 01:10:02.150
Copy Accelerator: Right to get in kind of come in.

744
01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:03.510
Copy Accelerator: But

745
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.259
Copy Accelerator: I mean, I would say, probably like A.

746
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.810
Copy Accelerator: And, by the way, if you look at the I know this is like on my screen. But people know there's something wrong

747
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.950
Copy Accelerator: yeah, there anymore. But so, going back to that, you know, something's wrong. But you don't know what like, I talked about with that very first one on hidden conservation.

748
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.066
Copy Accelerator: Similar concept. Right? But

749
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:27.010
Copy Accelerator: you know.

750
01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:29.020
Copy Accelerator: So you know.

751
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:36.269
Copy Accelerator: let's go do one more of these kind of like a criteria things and look, and we'll try to to take a shot at these sort of

752
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:37.560
Copy Accelerator: building blocks.

753
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:40.869
Copy Accelerator: I'll remove farts for now

754
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:10.640
Copy Accelerator: anyone, it's okay. If not, give you guys a chance here.

755
01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:14.090
Copy Accelerator: Okay, 10 s, 10,

756
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.260
Copy Accelerator: 9,

757
01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:18.800
Copy Accelerator: 8, 7, 6, 5

758
01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.340
Copy Accelerator: gluten. There's a hidden cause. Yeah.

759
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:25.649
Copy Accelerator: glimmer cause reaction. If you have, you're intolerant

760
01:11:26.974 --> 01:11:29.250
Copy Accelerator: but you have to say, maybe something else.

761
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.579
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I agree, basically something something like that, right? Like, we didn't

762
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.170
Copy Accelerator: is bad.

763
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.660
Copy Accelerator: there's a real

764
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:42.110
Copy Accelerator: hidden.

765
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.930
Copy Accelerator: Yeah.

766
01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:01.924
Copy Accelerator: it goes. Just keep it as simple as what might say, like hidden cause right? Like

767
01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:03.465
Copy Accelerator: like

768
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:06.790
Copy Accelerator: But really, it's like, you know.

769
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.529
Copy Accelerator: booting is bad, but

770
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:12.010
Copy Accelerator: there's a hidden

771
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:13.830
Copy Accelerator: plant, protein

772
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:19.499
Copy Accelerator: and foods that could be the real cause of your gut problems.

773
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.969
Copy Accelerator: Not good and

774
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.580
Copy Accelerator: right

775
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:30.229
Copy Accelerator: to said, Yeah, try anything better. They're actually super number. Yeah, that's good. That's good to hear.

776
01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:37.429
Copy Accelerator: So yeah, gloom is bad. There's a hand plant protein foods. Okay, there's something hidden in foods. You can just, you know, say, plant proteins or keep it really basic.

777
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.200
Copy Accelerator: something

778
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.199
Copy Accelerator: like hidden under unknown foods is is the real cause of your gut problems.

779
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:50.269
Copy Accelerator: Sorry gloom is bad, but there's an implant protein foods that could be the real cause. You've got problems

780
01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.599
Copy Accelerator: right. And that's sort of like our

781
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:55.790
Copy Accelerator: big idea, there's that comprehensible.

782
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.880
Copy Accelerator: Yeah.

783
01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:58.340
Copy Accelerator: Important

784
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:05.649
Copy Accelerator: again for the market, yeah, especially. And a lot of people are interested in gluten right? And they think that being gloom free, you may. They're spending a lot of money

785
01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.539
Copy Accelerator: like like he kind of loses an opening that ad.

786
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:10.460
Copy Accelerator: Suppose important, exciting.

787
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:12.590
Copy Accelerator: If you're into this sort of thing. Yeah.

788
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:33.832
Copy Accelerator: beneficial. Yeah. And I guess we haven't do is like, does that self support the copy? The Ca, but basically, it does like every time and everything we've looked at the copy helps, you know, the big idea to help support it, because it's like milkshakes. Right? Cookbook. The 2 missing fats for the dog. One was like something with that. Has those 2 missing fats right? The joint fats we call them 2 missing joint fats.

789
01:13:34.470 --> 01:13:38.119
Copy Accelerator: And here, like, yeah, I mean, where they're selling to some kind of like, gut, you know, probabic

790
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:45.070
Copy Accelerator: supplement thing. And so basically, if that helps to like, you know, that helps undo the the damage of this hidden plant protein.

791
01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.720
Copy Accelerator: So it's going to help do that

792
01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:50.069
Copy Accelerator: help to solve it. Right? Okay? So

793
01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:51.720
Copy Accelerator: I'm gonna stop here.

794
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:54.399
Copy Accelerator: And who has a

795
01:13:55.700 --> 01:14:06.140
Copy Accelerator: yeah, Darius said Glen, is an excuse to enter in the dialogue in the viewers. Mine gloom is popular. They connect you the root cause lectin or problem. Yeah, I'm sure it is lectin, right for the plant protein. And yeah, totally. It goes back to like

796
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:13.151
Copy Accelerator: entering the pro, the conversation, the prospects mind super viable. So okay, do you guys have any any questions

797
01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.129
Copy Accelerator: based on what we just gone through so far today.

798
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:24.299
Copy Accelerator: Well, that's just so far. But that's basically yeah, that's gonna be it for today. On this first big idea training, I'll tell you guys some action items, and and I'll talk about

799
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:31.049
Copy Accelerator: 2 other things. But if you have questions from the chat, and if you if you say Hey, I'd rather unmute myself. You can unmute yourself and and bring them up to

800
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:34.755
Copy Accelerator: while you're while you're doing that.

801
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:37.252
Copy Accelerator: Come back to that question a second Armen.

802
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.240
Copy Accelerator: you know.

803
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.140
Copy Accelerator: like I said before, I mean, I mentioned how there's a coke's first big ideas and some ads, and there's some like if I'm looking at. For example.

804
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:47.170
Copy Accelerator: a free plus shipping book funnel.

805
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:50.290
Copy Accelerator: right? Like I had. What I've gone through was just like.

806
01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:57.820
Copy Accelerator: you know, hey, new, my free book will show you how to become a millionaire in 90 days with these 7 like millionaire habits it's like.

807
01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:04.050
Copy Accelerator: Is there a big idea? I mean, you can do the same thing to go. 7 habits become a millionaire. But it's like

808
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:13.050
Copy Accelerator: as a really a big idea. I don't know but it's also like a free book that just has a really strong value proposition. And so we'll we'll talk about this in future calls. But, like.

809
01:15:13.210 --> 01:15:15.989
Copy Accelerator: you know, I just wanna be clear on that like. Not every

810
01:15:16.050 --> 01:15:20.649
Copy Accelerator: piece of copy you ever write has to have like a really big idea, especially for, like

811
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:27.880
Copy Accelerator: a simple, free plus shipping thing, or like a simple ad, something really direct. You know that being said

812
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.800
Copy Accelerator: still thinking about it, Mick, is there a way to kind of

813
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:32.230
Copy Accelerator: like a

814
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.100
Copy Accelerator: you know, confer a big idea is is like a

815
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.250
Copy Accelerator: not a bad way to go about it, you know. Keeping that in mind is definitely still valuable

816
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:47.906
Copy Accelerator: And the thing I want you guys to do is like sort of homework, let's say, between now and and next week, and then I will

817
01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:56.870
Copy Accelerator: come back to those questions in a second and answer any more. In addition to those, you know, I really try and be more. Be more aware. It's like that phenomenon of like

818
01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:04.659
Copy Accelerator: somebody mentions a model of a car. And then every time you're out driving, you see that car now, or you're thinking about buying a car right when you look at copy, whether it's for your own

819
01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.460
Copy Accelerator: company, by the company you work with the company that's yours, or you're just like on Facebook or Instagram or Tiktok.

820
01:16:10.764 --> 01:16:17.889
Copy Accelerator: you know, or you just click over to landing page, or you go as a consumer to something kind of like, you know, try to like.

821
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:21.080
Copy Accelerator: think about this right? Well, how would I break this down into like the different

822
01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.340
Copy Accelerator: components?

823
01:16:22.450 --> 01:16:34.269
Copy Accelerator: And then, like, you know, how could I? How does it match like that sort of criteria? I shared and then, you know, specifically, as you are writing, copy your ads, or whatever it is, you know, taking a minute to whatever you've you've written

824
01:16:35.086 --> 01:16:45.009
Copy Accelerator: to kind of sit back and be like, okay, what is the big idea? Is there a big idea here? What am I trying to say like, how does it match up? Is there a way I can make it more comprehensible?

825
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:49.360
Copy Accelerator: Feel more important, feel more exciting, you know, seem more beneficial.

826
01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.530
Copy Accelerator: And does this big idea really support?

827
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:56.069
Copy Accelerator: Copy, you know, selling the product. So that's like a really your action item

828
01:16:56.220 --> 01:16:59.930
Copy Accelerator: for like the week. Right? And I think that's a really, you know.

829
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:03.669
Copy Accelerator: this is good. The more you think about that the better. It is because, honestly

830
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:09.352
Copy Accelerator: like I put in that that email and that I share in the Whatsapp group as well. A link to in the Whatsapp group. But

831
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:16.369
Copy Accelerator: so much of copy really is about the ideas more than like the actual writing, like, it's really not that.

832
01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:20.370
Copy Accelerator: like, yeah, for long form and stuff. There's like structure, and there's like

833
01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:25.299
Copy Accelerator: nuance shit, we'll we'll talk about all that. It makes a difference. It's not not not important, but like

834
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:37.299
Copy Accelerator: the idea is the most important thing. If you can capture, captivate, you know, bring somebody in, make it feel exciting, beneficial, right, and it ties into the product. And and you, you know, it's really about point someone to that universe. And

835
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:39.920
Copy Accelerator: you know, if the idea is weak.

836
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:41.840
Copy Accelerator: then it doesn't really.

837
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.759
Copy Accelerator: nothing else really matters.

838
01:17:44.422 --> 01:17:50.480
Copy Accelerator: So the more you you're thinking about that, the better. Generally your copy and angles and hooks and ads, and all that stuff's going to be.

839
01:17:50.966 --> 01:18:05.573
Copy Accelerator: So I mean, said, you know, how do you recommend brainstorming big ideas for different products? So yeah, I'm gonna teach a a really specific process for that kind of breakthrough ideas process. I'm probably I it's I. Frankly, I think it's in circle, and you can go watch the trainings. I've done on the past.

840
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:12.850
Copy Accelerator: I think I'm gonna teach it again because it it works. It's worked multiple times. It's not the easiest thing to like

841
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:18.639
Copy Accelerator: teach in like an hour. So I'm gonna you know, I might take a couple of sessions on it, we'll see. But it's really

842
01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:34.080
Copy Accelerator: cool, and it works. And it's it's a really good process for doing that. But if you're anxious and want to go see it, it's I think if you if you search for breakthrough ideas and the members area. It should show up. If it doesn't let me know and circle or something, I'll make sure that it's there, you know, added, you guys have access to it.

843
01:18:34.970 --> 01:18:40.069
Copy Accelerator: you know, that's probably the the easiest, and then we'll go through more detail. And then Dario said.

844
01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:43.569
Copy Accelerator: is the big idea, a sexy way to present the outcome. We're promising.

845
01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:46.600
Copy Accelerator: I would say.

846
01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.140
Copy Accelerator: The big idea

847
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:59.049
Copy Accelerator: isn't always that as much as like the headline or the copy like that. That's the thing I don't think I really understood until recently with big ideas. It's like

848
01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:09.219
Copy Accelerator: going back to sort of like. The headline is like the manifestation of the big idea, or like the copy, is the manifestation of the big idea. I think that's all the the sexiness right like that's sort of all the

849
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.290
Copy Accelerator: the sizzle. But if I go back to like that, Mike Tyson one, it's really like.

850
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.690
Copy Accelerator: you know.

851
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.960
Copy Accelerator: like, yeah, it's related. But it's not. It's not directly

852
01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.939
Copy Accelerator: 100% direct that, like Mike Tyson used to be fat

853
01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.939
Copy Accelerator: like I'm sorry. My test is like scary dude, but inside of you feel like a fat, scared little kid.

854
01:19:28.455 --> 01:19:32.000
Copy Accelerator: Right? That yeah, it does. It supports it. But it's not like

855
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:35.190
Copy Accelerator: directly presenting the outcome is we're talking about Mike Tyson.

856
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:40.820
Copy Accelerator: sometimes it is more direct, like, obviously like the milkshake thing it's like, Hey.

857
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:42.410
Copy Accelerator: you know, drink milkshake

858
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:44.180
Copy Accelerator: being key to lose weight.

859
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:50.650
Copy Accelerator: Eat pancakes being cable lose weight. Right? That's that's more of a direct way, so it can be. But I don't think that's like a

860
01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.869
Copy Accelerator: it's not always that way, I guess I would say right. I mean, like again.

861
01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:57.969
Copy Accelerator: good fat. There's good farts and bad farts, and

862
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.087
Copy Accelerator: you know, like

863
01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:02.460
Copy Accelerator: you are what you eat.

864
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:07.570
Copy Accelerator: It's like, you know, if that if that is sort of like the big idea of that Gundry ad, it's not specifically saying

865
01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.370
Copy Accelerator: like,

866
01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:12.449
Copy Accelerator: it's implied. I guess it's implied more than it's explicit sometimes

867
01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.759
Copy Accelerator: any other questions before we wrap up.

868
01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:20.020
Copy Accelerator: Don't be shy if you got something.

869
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.429
Copy Accelerator: and if that's okay, you guys, was this was this good of our first training? Obviously, like, you know.

870
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.450
Copy Accelerator: I'm getting back into the

871
01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:33.000
Copy Accelerator: the group like the groove myself here on everything, I mean, I think let's keep most of these questions.

872
01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:39.690
Copy Accelerator: primarily on the topic here and then. But you know, through the the feedback thing, or whatever in the Whatsapp group, or whatever you can

873
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:45.751
Copy Accelerator: hit other topics. But just for that that to your personal question, what are your favorite kinds of headlines.

874
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:50.300
Copy Accelerator: y'all do a whole training on that. So answer that a bit more detail. Then I mean, I like.

875
01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.079
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I like headlines that just really

876
01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.199
Copy Accelerator: grab curiosity that really gets you to like.

877
01:20:56.470 --> 01:21:01.630
Copy Accelerator: kinda you know, kind of like almost to do a double take but yeah.

878
01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:13.730
Copy Accelerator: cool. And Ben, I'm glad it was helpful. I mean. I'll do. I'll do some, you know, in depth. Headline trainings for sure. Stefan. Glad to hear that, my fellow Stefan. So alright sweet! We'll get this replay up and and circle right the members area.

879
01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.260
Copy Accelerator: You'll have it under

880
01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:45.220
Copy Accelerator: whatever is there the weekly training recordings? We'll have a company and documents for that as well. We'll let you know. And Whatsapp and via email when those replays are, when the replays up and ready, and, you know, feel free to leverage the Whatsapp group as well. So for those of you who are, you know, on on various teams, and we're put in, you know, by whoever is running the business awesome. So glad again that you're here and leverage that Whatsapp group, if you're like, hey? I would think about the big idea stuff. Here's a question I have, or whatever it is, right and you know, both myself and and your peers can help to kind of bring clarity so

881
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:53.700
